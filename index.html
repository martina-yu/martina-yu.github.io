            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              I'm a senior undergraduate student at <strong>Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)</strong>, majoring in Preventive Medicine with a minor in Health Policy Management. From Fall 2020 to Spring 2025, I've undertaken over 90 courses, amassing more than 250 credits. I'm proud to have achieved a <strong>GPA of 3.91/4.0</strong> from Spring 2022 to Fall 2024, scoring above 89 in 43 courses—even though our university only awards top 30% of students with scores over 85.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              My academic interests span computational biology, deep learning, genetics, and medicine. My passion for computational programming ignited in 2021 when I began working on a CRISPR/Cas9 project under the mentorship of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7d3TckgAAAAJ">Prof. CD. Zhang</a>. Since then, I've participated in various projects involving deep learning models such as <code>GNN, LSTM, GAT, MML</code>, and have also gained experience in website design.

            <p class="text">
              I have a deep appreciation for Japanese culture—speaking some Japanese and enjoying Japanese songs. Additionally, I've been self-teaching drawing for over 10 years, creating more than 100 pieces of artwork for university and personal projects. This creative pursuit has not only enriched my life but also helped fund my travels and hobbies.

            <h3>First Research Experience</h3>
            <p class="text">
              In early 2022, I was thrilled to join <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7d3TckgAAAAJ">Prof. CD. Zhang's</a> lab. One of the first papers I delved into was "<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-00793-4">Deep learning design of adeno-associated virus capsids for gene therapy</a>." This paper introduced me to the exciting intersection of deep learning and biomedical research, laying the groundwork for my future projects.

            <h3>Exploring Multimodal Deep Learning in Medicine</h3>
            <p class="text">
              In September 2022, I engaged with the study "<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2022.07.004">Pan-cancer integrative histology-genomic analysis with deep learning</a>." Working with the TCGA database, I learned to process raw data and reproduce advanced methods like <a href="https://github.com/mahmoodlab/PORPOISE">PORPOISE</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM">CLAM</a>. This experience was pivotal in enhancing my understanding of applying deep learning techniques to cancer data analysis.

            <!-- AI Drug Competition -->
            <h3>Participation in the First AI Drug Competition by Baidu</h3>
            <p class="text">
              In May 2023, I participated in the <a href="https://aistudio.baidu.com/competition/detail/1012/0/task-definition">First Global AI Drug Development Competition</a> organized by Baidu. The competition centered on predicting the inhibitory activity of small molecules against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 using deep learning and docking methods. As part of the team, I contributed by updating outcomes and reproducing results in JupyterLab. Although we didn't secure an award, the competition significantly honed my Python programming skills and deepened my understanding of AI applications in drug development.

            <!-- Personal Growth -->
            <h3>Personal Growth and Character</h3>
            <p class="text">
              Throughout my academic journey, I've been driven by a genuine passion for learning rather than external accolades. I may not have always been at the top of my class initially, but my dedication and love for exploration have consistently propelled me forward. This intrinsic motivation has often led me to exceed expectations and achieve success in areas I'm truly passionate about.
